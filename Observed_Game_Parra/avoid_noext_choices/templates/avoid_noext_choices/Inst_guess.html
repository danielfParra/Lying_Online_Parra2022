<p>
    Participant B in your group has already picked a card.
    In the meantime, we want to know which card you think she or he drew and how confident you are of your guess.
</p>
<p>
    You can earn {{Constants.beliefs_payoff }} by guessing correctly. To increase your chances of earning this additional money,
    a robot will help you from the point where you are not sure.
    In particular, you only need to write down the color you think the computer (on behalf of Participant B) will report
    and how likely you think your guess is to be correct (i.e. if you believe there’s a 75% chance your guess is correct, you should write down 75).
</p>
<p>
    The selection of the robot is computerized, so you only have to tell us your guess and the chance it is correct.
    You don’t need to know the details how the robots work to continue with the experiment.
    However, if you want to find out details, click on "more information". If not click directly on "Next”.

        <p> We have 100 different robots; each has a different level of accuracy. Each robot has an accuracy corresponding to an integer between 1 and 100.
                That is, there is a robot that is accurate 1% of the time, a robot that is accurate 2% of the time, a robot that is accurate 3% of the time, ... , all the way up to a robot that is accurate 100% of the time. A robot that is accurate 75% of the time correctly guesses the other participant’s pick 75% of the time and guess wrongly 25% of the time.
            </p>
            <p>You have to decide which robots you would allow to guess for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's how it will work.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, you will select the color you think Participant B has drawn. Then, you will decide how confident you are in this guess. You will do this by choosing an accuracy threshold (a number between 1 and 100) for your answer. For any robot that has accuracy greater than or equal to your threshold, you would prefer to have the robot answering instead of submitting your guess. For any robot that has an accuracy lower than your threshold, you would prefer to submit your guess instead of letting the robot answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, the computer will randomly select a robot. Each robot is equally likely to be chosen. If the robot has an accuracy greater than or equal to your threshold, the robot will guess the other participant’s color for you. If the robot has an accuracy less than your threshold, your guess will be submitted and you will receive {{Constants.beliefs_payoff }} additional based upon that guess.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you chose 75% as your accuracy threshold, and the randomly selected robot had an accuracy of 90%, this robot would answer for you. The robot would have a 90% chance of guessing Participant B’s color correctly. If you chose 75% as your accuracy threshold, and the robot randomly selected had an accuracy of 20%, your answer would be submitted instead of the robot's.
